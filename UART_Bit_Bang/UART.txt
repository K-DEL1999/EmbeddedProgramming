UART -- Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit
====

This is a serial protocol that does not use a clock. A baud rate
is given which is the measurement of how many times a signal changes
per second in a communication channel. Rate at which information is 
transferred in a communication channel.

UART requires the user to know the difference between bits per second
and baud rate. Bits per second is how many bits can be sent in a second.
Baud rate refers to the number of symbols that can be send in a second.
Symbols in this case refer to the indivisible elements of you data
encoding.

The symbol can also be seen as the number of bits in a signal -- which is know
as the as the signal unit.

WHEN THE SIGNAL IS BINARY, THE BAUD RATE AND BIT RATE ARE THE SAME.


NOW TO THE PROTOCOL
===================

The protocol has 2 lines -- Tx(Transmit) and Rx(Receive). Tx connects to the Rx of
the other device and Rx connects to Tx. A baud rate is defined which determines
how many packets are sent in a second. A packet in UART is made up of a start bit,
data frame, polarity bit and stop bits. 
    
    Start Bit -- Tx is normally held HIGH when not transmitting. Tx is pulled low for
        1 bit then sends data. Rx is awoken by the start bit and then starts reading
        the data frame

    Data frame -- contains data which can be 5-8 bits long. If no parity bit is used then
        data can be 9 bits long.

    Parity Bit -- Bit that tells receiver whether there are an even number of 1s which is 0
        or whether there are an odd number of 1s which is 1.

    Stop Bits -- drive transmission line HIGH for atleast 2 bits. 
   
The rate at which a bit is send is calculated by -- 1s/baud_rate
