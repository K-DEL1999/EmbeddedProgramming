SPI Bit Bang
============

SPI works in different modes depending on wire count (3 to 4, MISO and MOSI can be 1 wire),
polarity refers to the idle state of the SPI (0 or 1 when master is not transmitting or receiving)
, phase refers to when are we clocking in and clocking out data (phase of 1 is shifting the start of the data half the period of the clock).

    The structure of PORT
    ======================
    https://developerhelp.microchip.com/xwiki/bin/view/products/mcu-mpu/8-bit-avr/structure/ioports/#:~:text=These%20pins%20are%20usually%20organized,%2C%20PortA%2C%20PortB%2C%20etc

    All ports have true Read-Modify-Write functionality when used as GDIO ports. Changing one
    pins direction, output drive (for output), or enabling/disabling pull-up resistors wont 
    effect the other pins. 

    protection diodes only allow current to flow in one direction and prevents random 
    voltage spikes.

    port consists of 3 registers -- DDRx : Data Direction Register
                                    PORTx : Pin Output Register
                                    PINx : Pin Inputer Register
                                    
    DDxn bits are accessed at DDRx I/0 address -- select the direction of the pin
        if DDxn is written to 1 Pxn is configured to output and 0 for input

    PORTxn bits at the PORTx I/O address -- controls output state of bin and setup of input pin
        if pin is output and a 1 is written then pin is driven high, 0 drives low
        if pin is input and 1 is written then pull up resistor is activated, 0 makes tri-state
        (tri-state -- floating state (copies nearby voltages) -- unconnected pin)
    
    PINxn bits at the PINx I/O address -- used to read data from the port pin. When pin is
        configured in digital input, in the DDRx register, and the pull up in enabled, the 
        bit will indicate the state of the signal at the pin (high or low).
    
        if pin is configured in output then reading the register will give youi the data 
        that has been write to the port pins. 
            
        In Tri-state input configuration (floating -- disconnected pin), state
        cannot be determined since surrounding objects change the logic state of the pin.
        Therefore pin cannot be read.
