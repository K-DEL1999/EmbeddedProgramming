I2C
===

Has 2 wires -- SDA(Serial Data) and SCL(Serial Clock). SDA is the line
for master and slave to send and receive data. SCL is the line which carries
the clock signal. This is a serial communication protocol meaning that data 
is transferred bit by bit. I2C is synchronous meaning that the output of bits 
is synchronized to the sampling of bits by a clock signal shared between 
master and slave - clock controlled by master.

I2C transfers data in messages. Messages are broken up into frames of data. 
Each message has an address frame - contains binary address of slave -- and one
or more data frames that contain the data being transmitted. The messages also
include start and stop conditions, read/write bits, and ack/no_ack bits between
each frame. Data frames are limited to 8 bits. 

    MAKE UP OF MESSAGE
    ==================
    start condtion - SDA goes from high to low before SCL goes from high to low 
    address frame - 7 to 10 bit sequence unique to each slave
    r/w bit - bit specifying if master wants to send or request data
    ack/no_ack bit - following every data frame sending ACK/NO_ACK
    data frame(byte) - data
    ack/no_ack bit
    data frame(byte) 
    ...
    ack/no_ack bit
    stop condtion - SDA goes from low to high after SCL goes from low to high
        
We need opendrain input/output lines
- the smaller the resistance the faster the response.

External pull ups are created by adding another jumper cable -- wire -- to the bus with either
a 3.3V/5V -- basically any voltage the microcontroller can handle -- or ground on the other end.
If connected to power it will be a pull up, if connected to ground it will be a pull down.
The pins must be open drain in order for the high impedance values to be pulled high/low. 
If we only allow the pull ups to pull the pins high then we prevent 2 controllers setting
the bus high at the same time, short circuiting everything on the bus. The open drain creates an
environment where you can only set the pin to floating and low. Pull up pulls floating states high.
