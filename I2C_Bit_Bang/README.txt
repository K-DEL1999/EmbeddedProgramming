// To Future me

// I believe you can shave off a few microseonds here and there with the while loops waiting
//  for certain levels to change state --- while (<flag>){}. During those times maybe the slave
//  or who ever is waiting can sleep so we save power. Overall  I am very satisfied with how 
//  this project turned out. Great Job !!! Everything works how I want it to work, the most helpful
//  thing I learned in this project was to set the levels on low and to read the levels on high. 
//  That one piece of knowledge was what helped really finish this project. 

// Also lets try to add a loggin system in the future. Other than that -- great job. Our goal is
//  much closer.
