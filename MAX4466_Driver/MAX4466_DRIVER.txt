This project was a fun introduction to audio input. The datasheets have become more
graph focused which is intimidating at first but after a while you get used to it. This 
was my first project dealing with an ADC and Sampling. I have been reading alot about 
DSP but plan on incorporating that in the next project. This project wasnt meant to 
employ any of the ideas the DSP book discusses. Instead it was meant to break the ice 
when it comes to stepping into the signals world. Again, it was a very fun and cool project.
Setting thresholds that activated LEDs based on the digitized voltage was satisfying to see.
Possible improvements would be to find a better way to sample instead of just waiting a set
amount of time and then taking a sample. I guess maybe take the average of samples over a 
period of time ? 

This was also my first time soldering. Long story short, it was awesome. Great work, keep going.
Im proud of you.
